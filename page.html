    <h3>About</h3>
    <p> Hi! My name is Janice Llamas and I am 17 years old. This is my third term at Clark College. A couple of things
        about myself is that I love to read,
        write, and bake. I recently learned how to knit and I'm really liking it so far! Also, I like to code as well.
        I'm not very good yet, but I know that with some practice and time, I can become a decent coder.</p>
    <h3>What do I want to accomplish in this class?</h3>
    <p>Of course, since this class is about Javascript, I'll be able to accomplish learning, well, Javascript
        (hopefully). However, what I want to acheive throughout this course is to find out how this language can help me
        in the real technological world. I want to be able to learn this language enough to understand it. For example,
        I can learn how to speak Russian, but only know a few words and then stop there. Sure, I'll probably will know
        how
        to say simple words such as red, cat, jacket, or "I like pizza". On the other hand, I probably won't be able to
        carry out a decent conversation with someone, knowing what I know. Same goes with any programming language
        course I am going to take. What I am going to learn in this class is going to challenge me, and what I am going
        to learn is going to help me motivate me to <em>keep learning</em>. I don't expect myself to finish this
        Javascript class and come out as a professional, but rather come out with a somewhat knowlegable mind willing to
        learn more. That's what I'm hoping to accomplish! To invest myself enough in this course and become interested
        (and I already am) in the language, and to learn something new everyday. Hopefully with enough knowledge,
        practice, and experience, someone will want to hire me in the future as a web developer.</p>
    <h3>Programming Skills/Languages</h3>
    <p>I've taken only a small amount of courses that have taught me programming languages. So here are the ones that I
        know
        so far or am familiar with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HMTL & CSS</li>
        <li>Python</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the languages above I like to learn about, however, the language that I enjoy the most coding and
        learning
        is Python.</p>
